## Personal reflection

- I choose blockchain devlopement because it's a rapidly growing role with great importance, but at same time isn't as mainstream as frontend devlopment, which land in sweet spot where there isn't as much competition as other roles.

- My skill set today is quite humble but I am dedicated to grow it as much as possible.

- tbh i dont think i have spare time to develope any skill that's not in the educational program, but if i pass all exams in time and still have time, i would like to learn Rust further, and learn more about Cryptography
